# Dotfiles

Here are some of my personal dotfiles, it is just a simple collection de functions,
alias and settings I find useful to have. If you are looking for my dotvim files
you can find them [here](https://github.com/mike325/.vim).
If you are a evil person then you may prefer to look at
[here](https://github.com/mike325/.emacs.d).

Feel free to make comments about my configuration and of course take anything
you want or find useful.

You can test some of the settings by linking then in your `$HOME`

```
$ ln -s ~/dotfiles/bashrc ~/.bashrc
```

**TODO**
- [ ] Make a simple script to copy or link the files in the folders that
I normally use.
